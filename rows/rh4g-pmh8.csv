,,,,,,,,,* Impervious surface acreages are calculated from NYCDEP GIS data derived from Spring 2001 high resolution (0.3 m) NYS Ortho Imagery using pattern recognition software.
,,,,,,,,,"** Water Bodies (column D) include reservoirs, lakes, ponds, and rivers/major streams but exclude minor streams and wetlands."
,,,,,,,,," *** To analyze the portion of potentially developable land area that is already impervious, percentages in column H represent the total  impervious acreage for each basin divided by the difference between the total basin area and the total water body area (i.e. F/E)."
,,,,,,,,,"**** Population density (column I) based on 2000 Census Data. See graph below for correllation between pop. density and % impervious over total  basin area (column I vs. column G). Column G is used in order to be consistent with pop. density, which is over total basin area - not land only."
